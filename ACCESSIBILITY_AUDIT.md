## Changes Made

### `app/globals.css`

### `hooks/useFocusTrap.ts` _(new)_
- Traps Tab/Shift+Tab inside modals when active
- Auto-focuses first focusable element on open
- Dispatches `modal:close` on Escape for parent handlers

### `hooks/useKeyboardNav.ts` _(new)_
- Arrow Up/Down (or Left/Right) navigation for lists and menus
- Home/End jump to first/last item
- Enter/Space fires `onSelect` callback
- Roving `tabIndex` pattern (WCAG 2.1 compliant)
